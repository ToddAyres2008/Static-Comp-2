# Static-Comp-2

This was fairly easy until I got to the section where I realized I had put my photos in as images and not background images making it nearly impossible to get the photo overlay to work on the photos. After many failed attempts, I learned my lesson on that given that it was breaking every time I tried to refactor. Took that one for the team. But I do enjoy these static comps overall.
